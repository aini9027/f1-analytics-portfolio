# Executive Summary (Template)

## Context
Quantify how driver performance, qualifying position, and pit-stop timing impact race outcomes.

## Key Findings (examples)
- Qualifying strongly correlates with finishing position.
- Early pit windows at certain circuits yield net position gains.
- Constructor pit-stop efficiency varies and affects points.

## Recommendations
- Prioritize qualifying setup at high track-position circuits.
- Target undercut windows on low-degradation tracks; avoid overcut on high-degradation tracks.
- Reduce pit variance via rehearsed procedures.

## Next Steps
- Enrich with telemetry (tyre, SC/VSC flags).
- Add visuals to dashboard and append to this report.
