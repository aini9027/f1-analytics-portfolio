# 🏎️ About This Project  
### Formula 1 Race Strategy Analytics — by Ammar Haider

This project showcases a complete **end-to-end data analytics pipeline** using real Formula 1 data.  
It simulates the work of an F1 performance analyst, covering everything from data ingestion to actionable race insights.

---

## 🎯 Purpose  
The goal is to analyze how **driver performance, tyre strategy, race pace, and telemetry** shape race outcomes — presenting insights through **SQL analytics, Python notebooks, Power BI dashboards, and FastF1 telemetry workflows**.

This project is designed as a **professional portfolio case study** for roles in:

- Data Analytics  
- Data Engineering  
- Sports Analytics  
- F1 or Motorsport Performance Analysis  
- BI/Reporting

## 🛠️ What This Project Demonstronstrates

### 🔹 1. Data Engineering & ETL  
- Importing data from **Ergast API**, **Kaggle**, and **FastF1**  
- Building a relational schema in SQLite  
- Cleaning multi-source datasets  
- Converting telemetry + lap data into analyzable tables

### 🔹 2. SQL Analytics  
- Driver consistency models  
- Pit-stop time loss calculations  
- Grid vs finish correlation  
- Circuit performance summaries  
- Team-level historical trends  

### 🔹 3. Python Data Analysis (pandas + FastF1)  
- Stint degradation curves  
- Tyre performance modeling  
- Telemetry: speed, throttle, braking, gear  
- Position evolution and racecraft metrics  
- Driver-vs-driver comparisons (VER vs HAM at Silverstone)

### 🔹 4. Visualization (Power BI / Tableau / Matplotlib)  
- KPI dashboards  
- Performance heatmaps  
- Time-series pace evolution  
- Driver scorecards  
- Stint boxplots & compound pace charts  

### 🔹 5. Storytelling & Insights  
- Overcut/undercut strategy moments  
- Tyre drop-off patterns  
- Consistency rankings  
- Race-winning factors  
- Driver scouting scorecard (coming soon)
